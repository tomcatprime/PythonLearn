# Intersect
# The .intersection() method calculates the intersection of two sets.

# The intersection of two sets is a new set that contains all of the elements that are in both original sets

# For example:

# a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# b = {3, 4, 5, 6}
# c = a.intersection(b)
# print(c)
# # {3, 4}

# Assignment
# Complete the get_common_formats function using the .intersection() method. It should take in two arguments, formats1 and formats2, each a list of strings representing the file formats supported by two different pieces of software.

# It should return a set of strings representing the file formats that are supported by both pieces of software.

def get_common_formats(formats1, formats2):
    a = set(formats1)
    b = set(formats2)
    c = a.intersection(b)
    return c
