# Zip
# The zip function takes two iterables (in this case lists), and returns a new iterable where each element is a tuple containing one element from each of the original iterables.

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [4, 5, 6]

# c = list(zip(a, b))
# print(c)
# # [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]

# Assignment
# Complete the pair_document_with_format function. It takes two lists as input: doc_names and doc_formats. Each list contains strings. The doc_names list contains the names of documents, and the doc_formats list contains the file formats of the documents.

# First, zip up the lists into a single list of tuples with the names as the first index and the formats as the second index in each tuple.

# Next, filter the list of tuples to only include tuples where the format is one of the given valid_formats.

# Return the result as a list.

valid_formats = [
    "docx",
    "pdf",
    "txt",
    "pptx",
    "ppt",
    "md",
